# TDD with React, Jest and Enzyme

## 1. Basic TDD of a function
Create a function which validates a string that contains a North American (NANPA) phone number.
It should contain the following characteristics:
* it must contain exactly 10 digits (0-9)
* if it contains separators, the digits must be in groups of 3, 3, 4. E.g., 647-555-1212
* valid separators are spaces ( ) or dashes (-)
* the first three digits may be surrounded by round brackets and be followed by a space
* no other characters are permitted

When the input is valid, the function will return `undefined`
When the input is invalid, the function will return a string containing an error message to display
